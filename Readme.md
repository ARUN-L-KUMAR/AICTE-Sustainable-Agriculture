# AICTE Cycle 3 (2025) - Sustainable Agriculture Project

## Crop Disease Detection using AI/ML

### Project Description
This project implements an AI-based crop disease detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help farmers identify plant diseases early and take appropriate action to prevent crop loss.

### Dataset
- **Source**: PlantVillage Dataset
- **Classes**: 16 different crop diseases and healthy plants
- **Images**: 7,025 processed images
- **Crops**: Tomato, Potato, Pepper (Bell)

### Week 1 Progress (30% Complete)
- [x] Data collection and loading
- [x] Image preprocessing and cleaning
- [x] Quality assurance and validation
- [x] Exploratory data analysis
- [x] Train-test split preparation

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** - Image processing
- **NumPy/Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - ML utilities
