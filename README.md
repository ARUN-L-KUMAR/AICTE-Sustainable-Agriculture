## 📊 Final Project Results & Analysis

### Model Performance Comparison
| Metric | Week 2 Baseline | Week 3 Enhanced | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Validation Accuracy** | 80.9% | 63.4% | -17.5% |
| **Training Epochs** | 10 epochs | 10 epochs (early stopping) | Same |
| **Dataset Size** | 7,025 images | 7,025 + augmentation | Increased |
| **Training Strategy** | Standard training | Data augmentation + callbacks | Enhanced |

### Key Findings
1. **Baseline Model**: Strong performance (80.9%) with standard training approach
2. **Enhanced Model**: Lower accuracy (63.4%) despite data augmentation
3. **Root Cause**: Overfitting due to aggressive data augmentation on limited dataset
4. **Learning**: Data augmentation requires careful tuning for small datasets

### Technical Insights
- **Data Augmentation Impact**: Heavy augmentation (rotation, shifts, zoom) may have made training too challenging
- **Early Stopping**: Model stopped at epoch 10, suggesting optimization difficulties
- **Class Imbalance**: Some disease classes had fewer samples, affecting augmentation effectiveness
- **Model Architecture**: CNN architecture may need adjustment for augmented data

### Future Improvements
1. **Reduce Augmentation Intensity**: Lower rotation angles, smaller shift ranges
2. **Progressive Training**: Start with less augmentation, gradually increase
3. **Architecture Optimization**: Add more regularization layers
4. **Dataset Expansion**: Collect more real-world samples for each class

---## 🧠 Model Workflow (Week 2)  
1. **Data Loading** → Load processed dataset (Week 1 output: `processed_data.pkl`)  
2. **Preprocessing** → One-hot encode labels, normalize images (128×128, RGB)  
3. **Model Building** → CNN with:
   - Conv2D + MaxPooling + BatchNormalization (3 blocks)  
   - Dense (fully connected) layers  
   - Dropout for regularization  
   - Softmax output for multi-class classification  
4. **Training** → 10 epochs using Adam optimizer & categorical cross-entropy  
5. **Evaluation** → Accuracy/Loss plots, classification report, confusion matrix  
6. **Saving Outputs** →  
   - Trained model → `crop_disease_model.h5`  
   - Training history → `training_history.pkl`

## ⚡ Note on Large Files (Git LFS)  
This repository uses **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** for model and processed data files:  
- `crop_disease_model.h5` → Trained CNN model (Week 2)  
- `processed_data.pkl` → Preprocessed dataset (Week 1 output)  
- `training_history.pkl` → Training history (Week 2)  

👉 Make sure you have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed before cloning:  
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/ARUN-L-KUMAR/AICTE-Sustainable-Agriculture.git
````

Without Git LFS, these files will appear as small text pointers instead of the actual models.
