---

### � Slide 6: Performance Analysis
**Why Did Week 3 Show Lower Accuracy?**

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Overfitting with Augmentation**: Heavy data augmentation made training more challenging
2. **Small Dataset Effect**: 7,025 images may be insufficient for aggressive augmentation
3. **Class Imbalance**: Some disease classes had fewer samples
4. **Learning Complexity**: Augmented data required more sophisticated learning

**Technical Insights:**
- Data augmentation can reduce performance on small datasets
- Early stopping prevented overfitting but limited learning potential
- Model architecture may need adjustment for augmented data
